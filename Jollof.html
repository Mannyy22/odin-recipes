        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil, plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>
                <li>14 oz diced tomato, 2 cans</li>
                <li>6 oz tomato paste, 1 can</li>
                <li>1 habanero pepper</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon mixed dried herbs</li>
                <li>3 chicken bouillon cubes, crushed</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups long grain rice, rinsed</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen mixed vegetable</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
                <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
                <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
